# Sudoku Solver

**Problem Statement:**
Create a program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically. The program should take an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and use an algorithm to fill in the missing numbers. It should use backtracking or other suitable techniques to explore possible solutions and find the correct arrangement of numbers for the puzzle. Once solved, the program should display the completed Sudoku grid.

**Procedure:**
1. The program displays a Sudoku grid in a graphical user interface (GUI).
2. Users can input the known numbers in the grid.
3. Clicking the "Solve" button triggers the program to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
4. The program uses backtracking to explore possible solutions.
5. If a solution is found, the solved puzzle is displayed in the grid.
6. If no solution exists, a message is displayed indicating that.

Note: The GUI is created using the Tkinter library in Python.

**Technologies Used:**
1. Python
2. Tkinter
3. Backtracking Algorithm
